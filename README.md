# What is Design-pattern ?

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general, reusable solution of how to solve a common problem when designing an application or system.

# Why design pattern is used ?

1. Patterns are proven solutions: They provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven techniques that reflect the experience and insights the developers that helped define them bring to the pattern.

2. Patterns can be easily reused: A pattern usually reflects an out of the box solution that can be adapted to suit our own needs. This feature makes them quite robust.

3. Patterns can be expressive: When we look at a pattern thereâ€™s generally a set structure and vocabulary to the solution presented that can help express rather large solutions quite elegantly.

# Types of the design pattern

There are three main types of design patterns :-

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural
